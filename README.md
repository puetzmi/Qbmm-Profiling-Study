# Investigation of the Basic Inversion Procedure of Quadrature-Based Moment Methods with respect to Performance and Accuracy

The aim of this study is to examine the differences with respect to performance and accuracy using different implementations of the quadrature method of moments and derived methods. This repository is designed only as a submodule of the code repository `Qbmm Profiling Tools`, see 'Prerequisites' below.


#### Prerequisites

For the contents of this project to work properly, this repository must be a submodule of the main code repository available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/puetzm/qbmm-profiling-tools) and [GitHub](https://github.com/puetzmi/Qbmm-Profiling-Tools). For information on the requirements to build and run the code, see the instructions in that project.


#### Contents

This repository contains the configuration files and scripts for different numerical studies as subdirectories. Due to the file size, neither the input data generated by `generate_input_data.sh` nor the output data generated by the different applications are currently tracked, but may be made available in some other way in the future.
